# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
This is is a project to help me understand how to build a social media API using NoSQL, specifically MongoDB and Mongoose. It helped me learn how social media apps create, update, and delete users, thoughts, friends lists, and reactions. 

## Usage
To use this application, install the packages and then start the application by using node server.js or npm run start. You will than be able to test the routes using Insomia. The linked video demonstrates how to use the application.
